I help corporations, businesses (large and small), charities, and governments with service design, experience design, and design thinking. I also take photos and occasionally do some writing.

Currently, I’m Chief of Design for the Canadian Digital Service, a new initiative from the Government of Canada to make simple, easy to use services. Previously, I was the Head of Design (UX, Interaction & Service Design) for the Ministry of Justice, with the UK Government. And before that, I was Design Lead at the world's largest travel company, Expedia.
